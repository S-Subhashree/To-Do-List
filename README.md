To create a "To Do List" application using Python with HTML and CSS, you'll typically want to break down the project into several components. Below is a high-level overview and example code snippets to help you get started.

**1. Project Structure**

Here's a basic structure for your project:

todo_list/
│
├── app.py
├── static/
│   ├── style.css
│
└── templates/
    └── index.html
    
**2. Python (Flask) Setup**
We'll use Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.

**Install Flask:**
pip install Flask

**3. HTML Template:**
templates/index.html

**4. CSS Styling:**
static/style.css

**5. Running your Application:**
To run your Flask application, execute the following command in your terminal:

**python app.py**

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see your "To Do List" app in action.

**Summary:**

This example sets up a simple "To Do List" web application with Flask, HTML, and CSS. The Flask app handles adding and deleting tasks, while the HTML provides the structure and the CSS adds styling to the application.
Feel free to expand and modify this project as needed! For example, you might want to add persistent storage using a database or enhance the styling and functionality.
